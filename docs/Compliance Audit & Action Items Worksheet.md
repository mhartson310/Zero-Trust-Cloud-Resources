# Compliance Audit & Action Items Worksheet

**Purpose:**  
This worksheet tracks compliance audits, identifies gaps, and documents remediation actions to ensure continuous adherence to regulatory standards. It covers audits against key standards including CIS, CSA, NIST, and FedRAMP. The goal is to drive continuous improvement toward a full Zero Trust Architecture in Azure while managing accepted risks.

---

## Standards Overview

- **CIS (Center for Internet Security):**  
  Practical, prescriptive controls for securing IT systems. Ideal for organizations looking for clear, actionable benchmarks.

- **CSA (Cloud Security Alliance â€“ Cloud Controls Matrix):**  
  Cloud-specific best practices covering governance, data security, and virtualization. Valuable for cloud-centric environments.

- **NIST SP 800-53:**  
  Comprehensive, rigorous security controls widely adopted in regulated industries and government sectors.

- **FedRAMP:**  
  Stringent, federal-specific requirements ensuring cloud service providers meet continuous monitoring and high security standards.

*Similarities:* All standards emphasize access control, encryption, continuous monitoring, and incident response.  
*Differences:* CIS is straightforward and prescriptive; CSA focuses on cloud-specific risks; NIST is extensive; FedRAMP builds on NIST with additional federal requirements.
