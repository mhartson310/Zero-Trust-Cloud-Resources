# üí° Common Use Cases for Microsoft Entra Verified ID

Microsoft Entra Verified ID (formerly Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials) opens up a world of possibilities for secure, privacy-preserving, and streamlined identity verification. By enabling organizations to issue, hold, and verify digital credentials, it addresses many common identity challenges across various sectors.

This guide explores some of the most impactful and frequently encountered use cases for Microsoft Entra Verified ID.

## ü§ù Employee Onboarding and Verification

One of the most immediate benefits of Verified ID lies in simplifying and securing the employee lifecycle.

* **Scenario:** A new employee joins your organization.
* **Traditional Challenge:** Manual verification of identity documents, educational certificates, and professional licenses is time-consuming, prone to errors, and can expose sensitive PII.
* **Verified ID Solution:**
    1.  **Identity Proofing:** Your HR department (or a trusted third-party identity proofing service) issues verifiable credentials (VCs) representing the employee's verified identity, educational degrees, or professional certifications.
    2.  **Streamlined Onboarding:** The employee presents these VCs from their digital wallet to prove their identity and qualifications during onboarding. This can replace or reduce the need for physical document checks.
    3.  **Access Provisioning:** VCs can be used to explicitly verify an employee's role or department, triggering automated provisioning of access to relevant internal systems and applications.
* **Zero Trust Alignment:** **Verify Explicitly** and **Use Least Privilege**. Access is granted based on verified attributes, not just a username/password, and only the necessary attributes are shared.

## üöÄ Customer Onboarding and Identity Verification (KYC/KYB)

For financial services, healthcare, or any industry requiring robust "Know Your Customer" (KYC) or "Know Your Business" (KYB) processes, Verified ID offers significant advantages.

* **Scenario:** A new customer wants to open a bank account or apply for a loan online.
* **Traditional Challenge:** Customers must submit multiple documents (ID, proof of address, income statements), leading to slow onboarding, high abandonment rates, and increased fraud risk.
* **Verified ID Solution:**
    1.  **Trusted Issuers:** Government agencies issue verified identity VCs. Educational institutions issue degree VCs. Employers issue employment VCs.
    2.  **Instant Verification:** The customer presents a verified identity VC from a trusted issuer. The bank can instantly verify the authenticity of the VC and the identity attributes it contains, significantly speeding up the KYC process.
    3.  **Enhanced Fraud Prevention:** Cryptographic proofs tied to VCs make them highly tamper-resistant, reducing identity fraud.
* **Zero Trust Alignment:** **Verify Explicitly**. The bank explicitly verifies the authenticity and integrity of identity claims made by the customer.

## üîë Secure Access to Resources and Applications

Verified IDs can act as privacy-enhancing, context-aware access credentials.

* **Scenario:** An external contractor needs temporary access to specific internal applications or a specific environment.
* **Traditional Challenge:** Managing temporary accounts, ensuring least privilege, and revoking access promptly can be complex and risky.
* **Verified ID Solution:**
    1.  **Role-Based VCs:** Your organization issues a VC to the contractor verifying their role and the duration of their engagement.
    2.  **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Applications can verify the contractor's VC, checking attributes like `role: contractor`, `project: X`, and `validUntil: YYYY-MM-DD`, granting access only if all conditions are met.
    3.  **Dynamic Access:** Access can be granted or revoked dynamically by issuing new VCs or revoking existing ones, based on the real-time needs.
* **Zero Trust Alignment:** **Use Least Privilege** and **Verify Explicitly**. Access is precisely controlled based on verified attributes, and access is explicitly re-verified at each access attempt.

## üéì Academic and Professional Credentialing

Digital certificates, diplomas, and professional licenses are perfect candidates for verifiable credentials.

* **Scenario:** A university wants to issue tamper-proof diplomas to graduates.
* **Traditional Challenge:** Paper diplomas are easy to forge, and verifying their authenticity can be a burden for employers.
* **Verified ID Solution:**
    1.  **Instant Issuance:** The university issues digital diplomas as VCs directly to graduates' wallets upon completion.
    2.  **Effortless Verification:** Graduates can easily share their verified diploma VC with potential employers, who can instantly verify its authenticity and integrity via the university's public DID.
* **Zero Trust Alignment:** **Verify Explicitly**. The employer explicitly verifies the legitimacy of the educational credential directly from the issuer, eliminating assumptions.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Supply Chain Transparency and Verification

Ensuring the authenticity and provenance of goods or components in a supply chain.

* **Scenario:** A manufacturer needs to verify that components received from suppliers meet specific quality or origin standards.
* **Traditional Challenge:** Relying on paper certificates or unverified digital documents introduces risks of fraud and lack of transparency.
* **Verified ID Solution:**
    1.  **Component VCs:** Suppliers issue VCs for components, verifying their origin, materials, or quality certifications.
    2.  **Automated Verification:** The manufacturer's systems can automatically verify these VCs upon receipt, ensuring compliance and authenticity before integrating components into products.
* **Zero Trust Alignment:** **Verify Explicitly** and **Assume Breach**. Trust in components is never assumed; it's explicitly verified at each hand-off point.

These are just a few examples, and the potential applications for Microsoft Entra Verified ID are continually expanding as organizations embrace decentralized identity for greater security and privacy.
