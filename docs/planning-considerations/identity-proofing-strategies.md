# üéØ Identity Proofing Strategies for Verified ID Issuance

Issuing a verifiable credential (VC) is a powerful act of digital trust. For a VC to be truly valuable and trustworthy, the **issuer** must have a high degree of confidence in the identity of the **holder** *before* the credential is issued. This process of confirming an individual's identity is known as **identity proofing**.

This guide explores various strategies for identity proofing when issuing Microsoft Entra Verified IDs, aligning them with security and compliance needs.

## Why Identity Proofing is Critical

The strength of a verifiable credential hinges on the assurance level of the identity proofing process used by the issuer. If a credential attests to a "verified employee," but the employee's identity wasn't sufficiently proven, the entire trust chain can break down.

A robust identity proofing strategy ensures:
* **High Assurance:** The VC accurately reflects the verified attributes of the individual.
* **Fraud Prevention:** Reduces the risk of issuing credentials to imposters.
* **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements (e.g., KYC/AML) for identity verification.

## Identity Proofing Strategies

The choice of identity proofing strategy depends on the **assurance level** required for the specific verifiable credential. Higher assurance credentials (e.g., for financial transactions) will require more rigorous proofing than lower assurance ones (e.g., a simple membership card).

### 1. üßë‚Äçüíª Existing Digital Identity Verification (Low-to-Medium Assurance)

If you already have an established digital relationship with the user through a trusted identity provider (IdP), you can leverage that for proofing.

* **Method:**
    * **SSO Integration:** The user logs in to your application using an existing Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Google).
    * **Attribute Transfer:** Your application retrieves verified attributes (e.g., name, email, employee ID) from the IdP.
    * **VC Issuance:** Based on these attributes, you issue a VC attesting to the user's identity.
* **Use Cases:** Issuing employee badges, verified student credentials, or membership cards within an organization where identity is already centrally managed.
* **Pros:** Streamlined UX, leveraging existing trust, relatively low cost.
* **Cons:** Assurance level is dependent on the original IdP's proofing methods.

### 2. üìÑ Document-Based Verification (Medium-to-High Assurance)

This involves verifying physical identity documents, often with digital assistance.

* **Method:**
    * **Manual Review:** User submits scans/photos of government-issued IDs (passport, driver's license), and a human agent manually reviews them.
    * **Automated Document Verification (ADV):** Users upload document scans, and AI/ML-powered services (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID Protection features, third-party IDV vendors like Onfido, Jumio, Veriff) extract data, check for tampering, and verify authenticity against databases.
* **Use Cases:** KYC for financial services, age verification, citizen services.
* **Pros:** High assurance, verifiable against official sources.
* **Cons:** Can be slow if manual, requires robust ADV services, privacy considerations for document handling.

### 3. üì∏ Biometric Verification (High Assurance)

Combining document verification with liveness checks or facial recognition.

* **Method:**
    * **Live Liveness Check:** User performs a real-time selfie or video recording (e.g., turning head, blinking) to prove they are a live person matching their document photo.
    * **Facial Biometric Matching:** Facial scan from the live selfie is compared against the photo on the provided identity document.
* **Use Cases:** High-security financial transactions, critical government services, access to highly sensitive systems.
* **Pros:** Very high assurance, strong fraud deterrence.
* **Cons:** Requires sophisticated technology, potential for bias in algorithms, significant privacy implications, user comfort.

### 4. üìû Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Possession-Based (Medium Assurance)

Leveraging strong authentication methods during the proofing process.

* **Method:**
    * **Registered Device:** Issuing a VC to a device that's already strongly authenticated (e.g., corporate-issued device with MFA).
    * **SMS/Email Code + Existing Credential:** Confirming ownership of a phone number or email address by sending a one-time code, combined with login via an existing, proven identity.
* **Use Cases:** Confirming account recovery, issuing a credential for a secondary service.
* **Pros:** Adds a layer of proof to existing digital identities, relatively easy to implement.
* **Cons:** Not suitable as a primary identity proofing method for high assurance.

### 5. üè¢ In-Person Verification (Highest Assurance)

The traditional gold standard for identity proofing.

* **Method:**
    * User physically presents documents to a trusted agent (e.g., at a bank branch, government office) who visually inspects documents and verifies identity.
* **Use Cases:** Situations demanding absolute certainty of identity, often combined with other methods.
* **Pros:** Extremely high assurance, provides a human touchpoint.
* **Cons:** Not scalable, costly, inconvenient for users.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

When selecting an identity proofing strategy for your Verified ID issuance, consider:

* **Assurance Level Required:** How much trust do you need in the verified attributes?
* **Compliance Requirements:** Are there specific regulations you must adhere to (e.g., KYC/AML)?
* **User Experience:** How seamless and secure should the proofing process be for your users?
* **Cost and Scalability:** What are the financial and operational implications of each method?
* **Privacy Implications:** How will sensitive PII be handled and protected during proofing?

By carefully designing your identity proofing process, you lay a strong foundation for the trustworthiness and utility of the verifiable credentials you issue.
