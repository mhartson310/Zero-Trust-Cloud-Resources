## 1. Common Issues & Error Resolutions

### Issue: **Resource Group or Resource Deployment Fails**
- **Symptoms:**  
  - Terraform errors indicating resource conflicts or insufficient permissions.
  - Azure Portal shows ‚ÄúResource group not found‚Äù or similar errors.
- **Resolutions:**  
  - **Verify Permissions:** Ensure you have the correct RBAC roles (e.g., Contributor or Owner) assigned.
  - **Check Naming Conventions:** Make sure resource names are unique and follow Azure naming rules.
  - **Review Terraform Plan:** Run `terraform plan` to identify issues before applying changes.

### Issue: **VNet Peering Fails or Times Out**
- **Symptoms:**  
  - Errors during VNet peering configuration.
  - Peering status shows ‚ÄúDisconnected‚Äù or ‚ÄúFailed.‚Äù
- **Resolutions:**  
  - **Address Space Overlap:** Confirm that the address spaces for the peered VNets do not overlap.
  - **NSG and Firewall Rules:** Ensure that NSGs or firewalls are not blocking the peering traffic.
  - **Azure Limits:** Check if you have exceeded the peering limits per virtual network.

---

### Issue: **NSG Rules Not Applying as Expected**
- **Symptoms:**  
  - Traffic is not being blocked/allowed as per the configured rules.
  - Inbound or outbound connections are misrouted.
- **Resolutions:**  
  - **Rule Priority:** Verify the priority of NSG rules; lower numbers have higher precedence.
  - **Association:** Ensure the NSG is correctly associated with the intended subnet or network interface.
  - **Diagnostics:** Use **NSG Flow Logs** via Azure Network Watcher to diagnose issues.

---

### Issue: **Log Analytics or Monitoring Data Missing**
- **Symptoms:**  
  - No logs appearing in the Log Analytics workspace.
  - Azure Monitor dashboards are empty or outdated.
- **Resolutions:**  
  - **Diagnostic Settings:** Confirm that diagnostic settings are enabled for all relevant resources.
  - **Workspace Connection:** Verify that resources are correctly connected to the Log Analytics workspace.
  - **Retention Policies:** Check that retention policies are configured to retain logs for the desired period.

## 2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: **How do I update the Terraform configuration without downtime?**
- **A:**  
  - Use **Terraform‚Äôs incremental changes** by running `terraform plan` to preview updates.
  - Implement **blue-green deployments** or use **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates** in parallel to minimize downtime.
  - Consider **state locking** to prevent concurrent modifications.

---

### Q2: **What should I do if my deployment exceeds Azure‚Äôs resource limits?**
- **A:**  
  - Review Azure subscription limits and request an increase if necessary.
  - Optimize resource utilization by consolidating or decommissioning unused resources.
  - Use **Azure Cost Management** to monitor usage and plan for scale.

---

### Q3: **Why is my VNet peering not connecting even though the configurations seem correct?**
- **A:**  
  - Ensure that there is no address space overlap.
  - Check that both VNets are in the same Azure region (or properly configured for global peering).
  - Validate that no NSG or firewall settings are blocking the necessary traffic.

---

### Q4: **How can I ensure my backups are reliable?**
- **A:**  
  - Regularly test backup and restore procedures.
  - Monitor backup jobs via **Azure Backup Reports**.
  - Implement **redundant backups** across different regions if possible.

---

### Q5: **What are the key steps to follow after deploying the Zero Trust solution?**
- **A:**  
  - Perform a thorough audit using the **Security Baseline Checklist**.
  - Set up continuous monitoring with **Azure Sentinel** and **Log Analytics**.
  - Schedule regular security reviews, penetration tests, and update your incident response playbooks.
