## 5. ROI & Savings Analysis
_Analyze the financial benefits of your cloud security and Zero Trust initiatives._

**Calculations:**
- **Total Initial Investment:** $[X]
- **Monthly Ongoing Costs:** $[Y]
- **Estimated Annual Ongoing Costs:** $[Y * 12]
- **Estimated Annual Savings:** $[Z] (savings from reduced incidents, increased automation efficiency, etc.)
- **ROI Calculation:**
  \[
  ROI = \frac{(\text{Annual Savings} - \text{Annual Ongoing Costs})}{\text{Total Initial Investment}} \times 100\%
  \]
- **Payback Period (in months):**
  \[
  \text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Total Initial Investment} + \text{Annual Ongoing Costs}}{\text{Annual Savings}} \times 12
  \]

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Reduction in security incidents (pre- vs. post-implementation)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Compliance audit improvements
- Cost savings from automation and operational efficiencies

## 6. Additional Notes & Assumptions
- **Assumptions:**  
  - Cost estimates based on current Azure pricing models.
  - Operational overhead is estimated based on historical data.
  - Savings estimates derived from reduced incident response times and increased automation.
- **Risks:**  
  - Consumption variability may lead to cost fluctuations.
  - Unexpected integration challenges may delay ROI realization.
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Validate estimates with a pilot deployment.
  - Regularly review and update cost data.
  - Integrate with Azure Cost Management for automated, real-time cost tracking.
