# Cost Tracking & Budget Control Worksheet for Azure Security and Zero Trust Initiatives


## Overview

This **Cost Tracking & Budget Control Worksheet** is designed to monitor Azure cloud costs, compare actual expenditures with budgeted amounts, and analyze the cost efficiency of security and Zero Trust initiatives. It’s built for sharing on both a blog and GitHub, aligning with plans to develop an Azure cost savings tool using Python and Azure. The current date is **February 21, 2025**, and this worksheet reflects up-to-date pricing and strategies.

### Purpose
- Monitor cloud costs tied to Azure security and Zero Trust implementations.
- Compare budgeted vs. actual expenditures.
- Quantify savings from automation and incident reduction.
- Calculate ROI and payback periods for financial justification.

### Savings from Automation and Incident Reduction Section

#### Security Incidents
| **Period**                     | **Number of Incidents** | **Avg Cost per Incident** | **Total Cost** |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Before Implementation (avg/mo) | [Number]                | [Cost]                    | [Total]        |

### ROI Calculations Section

1. **Total Investment:** Sum of monthly costs (initial setup + ongoing).
2. **Total Benefits:** Sum of monthly savings (incidents + automation).
3. **Simple ROI: ((Total Benefits - Total Investment) / Total Investment) × 100%**
4. **Payback Period: Total Investment / Monthly Savings (in months)**

- Plot cumulative savings vs. investment for precise timing.

#### Example Calculation
- **Investment:** $10,000/month × 12 = $120,000/year
- **Savings:** $2,500/month (incidents) + $1,000/month (automation) = $3,500/month
- **ROI:** (($3,500 × 12 - $120,000) / $120,000) × 100% = -65% (year 1, partial recovery)
- **Payback Period:** $120,000 / $3,500 ≈ 34 months

## Implementation Tips

- **Manual Use:** Fill tables manually in Excel or a Markdown editor.
- **Automation Potential:** Use Python with Azure Cost Management APIs to pull real-time data and calculate metrics.
- Example:
```python
from azure.mgmt.costmanagement import CostManagementClient
# Authenticate and fetch cost data
