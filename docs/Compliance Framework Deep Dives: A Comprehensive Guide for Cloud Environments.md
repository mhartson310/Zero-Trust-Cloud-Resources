### 3.5. (Optional) Data Privacy Frameworks: GDPR and HIPAA
#### Overview
Data privacy frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA focus on protecting personal and health-related data. While not exclusively IT security frameworks, they impose strict controls on data processing, storage, and access.

#### Implementation in Cloud Environments
- **Key Requirements:** Data classification, encryption, user consent management, and robust audit trails.
- **Tools & Processes:** Use Azure Key Vault for secure key management, implement strict access controls via Azure AD, and use automated compliance audits.
