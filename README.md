## Overview
This repository contains:
- **Terraform Scripts**: Deploy essential AI/cloud resources in Azure with secure configurations.
- **Azure Logic App Playbooks**: Sample playbooks that automate incident response and incorporate external AI analysis.
- **Compliance Checklists**: Interactive and non-interactive compliance checklists to ensure your environment meets regulatory standards.
  
Our approach follows **Zero Trust principles**â€”never assume trust, verify everything, enforce least privilege, and continuously monitor.

## Folder Structure


## Zero Trust Best Practices Explained
We follow Zero Trust best practices throughout our templates:
- **Least Privilege**: Resources are provisioned with minimal access rights.
- **Network Segmentation**: Resources are logically segmented to reduce lateral movement risks.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated playbooks and compliance checklists help maintain real-time awareness of security posture.
- **Automation & Verification**: Infrastructure as code (Terraform) and automated playbooks ensure consistency and enable rapid remediation.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Terraform Scripts**:  
   - Navigate to the `terraform/` folder.
   - Customize the variables in `variables.tf` as needed.
   - Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to deploy resources.
  
2. **Azure Logic App Playbooks**:  
   - The `playbooks/azure_logic_app_playbook.json` file is a sample playbook for automating incident response.
   - Import this JSON into Azure Logic Apps and update the configuration (e.g., API keys, endpoints) as needed.
  
3. **Compliance Checklists**:  
   - Use the interactive version (`checklists/compliance-checklist.html`) in a browser for a dynamic checklist experience.
   - The non-interactive version (`checklists/compliance-checklist.md`) is available for documentation or internal audits.
  
4. **Customization & Extension**:  
   - Feel free to fork this repository and tailor the templates to fit your specific cloud environment and security policies.
